Investigating Ionospheric Plasma Drifts and Thermospheric Neutral Winds Using CubeSats

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Introduction

The project aimed at calculating the calibration factor and the thermospheric neutral wind speeds using data 
collected by the Phoenix Cubesat from the QB50 mission. 

*Project Directory 

The data analysis conducted in this project produced files found in the folder "Rifat's project". The folder
contains "hwm_models", "INMSdata" and "nrlmsise_models", which are the MATLAB Notebooks with all the main data 
analysis and processing. Running those files will produce the graphs, plots and results from calculations. 
This folder also contains "Cleaning_INMSfiles", which is a python notebook that cleans previously incorrect INMS
data. The excel sheets in this folder INMS data+pitch data and calculations made with the IRI model. 

A subfolder called "CorrectINMSdata" contains the cleaned textfiles and excel sheets provided by Sachin Reddy.
It also contains all the MATLAB functions used in the previously mentioned MATLAB notebooks. These functions and
the notebooks all have lines of code starting with cd "directory" at some point. Please do change these directories 
accordingly. 

Another subfolder is called "Plots". This contains some example plots saved from the MATLAB notebook's plots.
Not all the plots were saved as the Notebook style MATLAB files are able display graphs. 

*Requirements

Do not change the structure of the folder and its content. Do change the directories in the lines of code to your
own directory in which this folder is saved in.
